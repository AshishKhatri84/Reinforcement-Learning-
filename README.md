# Reinforcement Learning Project: Multi-Environment Exploration
Purpose of the Application:
This repository contains various reinforcement learning simulations, including Q-learning, SARSA, and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), applied to environments like Frozen Lake, CartPole, GridWorld, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Bipedal Simulation. The purpose of this application is to provide interactive simulations with visualization, agent training, and comparative analysis of different reinforcement learning algorithms.

Project Description:
The project consists of multiple reinforcement learning implementations, covering:

Tabular methods (Q-learning, SARSA)
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN for CartPole)
Grid-based and dynamic simulations (Frozen Lake, Bipedal Simulation)
Comparative analysis of Q-learning vs SARSA
These implementations help understand exploration vs exploitation, reward learning, and decision-making processes in AI agents.
